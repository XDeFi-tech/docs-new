# ZkSync (ETH)

zkSync is a zero-knowledge (zk) Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, developed by Matter Labs. Built on zk-rollup technology, zkSync enables fast, low-cost, and secure transactions while preserving full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility through its zkSync Era network.

zkSync allows developers to deploy existing Ethereum smart contracts with minimal changes and benefit from the scalability and security of zk-rollups. It supports a wide range of Web3 applications, including DeFi, NFTs, and gaming, with a focus on user and developer experience.

This documentation is based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the Ethereum network.
