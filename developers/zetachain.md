# ZetaChain (ZETA)

ZetaChain is an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain designed for seamless cross-chain interoperability. It enables developers to build omnichain decentralized applications (dApps) that can interact with assets and data across any blockchain — including non-smart-contract chains like Bitcoin — using a single smart contract.

With native support for cross-chain messaging and asset transfers, ZetaChain eliminates the need for wrapped tokens or complex bridging infrastructure. Its EVM compatibility ensures that developers can deploy Ethereum smart contracts with minimal changes while accessing a unified cross-chain environment.

This documentation is based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the Ethereum network.
