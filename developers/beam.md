# Beam (BEAM)

Beam is an Ethereum Layer 2 network built to support the Beam ecosystem — a gaming-focused platform developed by Merit Circle. Leveraging Optimism’s OP Stack, Beam delivers high throughput, low fees, and full EVM compatibility, making it ideal for game developers and Web3 applications.

Beam enables seamless deployment of Ethereum smart contracts while providing a fast and cost-effective environment tailored for gaming use cases. It integrates deeply with NFT infrastructure, in-game assets, and on-chain logic to power next-generation blockchain games.

This documentation is based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the Ethereum network.
