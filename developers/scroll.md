# Scroll (ETH)

Scroll is a native zkEVM Layer 2 network designed to scale Ethereum using zero-knowledge rollups while preserving full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. Developed with a strong focus on decentralization, transparency, and open-source principles, Scroll enables seamless deployment of existing Ethereum smart contracts without modification.

By leveraging zk-rollup technology, Scroll offers fast, low-cost transactions with strong security guarantees inherited from Ethereum Layer 1. It is built to support scalable, efficient, and developer-friendly dApps across DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 infrastructure.

This documentation is based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the Ethereum network.
