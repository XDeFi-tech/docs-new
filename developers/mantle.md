# Mantle (MNT)

Mantle is a high-performance Ethereum Layer 2 network built using modular architecture and powered by Optimistic rollups. Developed by the Mantle community and governed by the Mantle DAO (previously BitDAO), Mantle aims to offer low-cost, fast, and scalable infrastructure for Web3 applications.

Mantle is fully EVM-compatible, allowing seamless deployment of Ethereum smart contracts. It introduces an innovative data availability layer using EigenDA to reduce costs while maintaining Ethereum-level security.

This documentation is based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the Ethereum network.
