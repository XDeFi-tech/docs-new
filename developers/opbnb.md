# OpBNB (ETH)

OpBNB is a Layer 2 scaling solution built on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) using the Optimism OP Stack. It is designed to deliver high throughput, low transaction fees, and EVM compatibility, enabling developers to deploy Ethereum-based smart contracts efficiently within the BNB ecosystem.

opBNB inherits BSCâ€™s fast finality and integrates seamlessly with its infrastructure, making it ideal for building scalable dApps across DeFi, gaming, and Web3 applications. With Optimistic Rollup technology, opBNB enhances scalability while maintaining the security and decentralization benefits of Layer 1.

This documentation is based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the Ethereum network.
