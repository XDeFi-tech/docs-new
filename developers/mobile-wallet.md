# Mobile Wallet Integration

This document provides details on integrating and interacting with the **Ctrl Mobile Wallet**, which supports multiple blockchain networks and decentralized applications (dApps) via Reown (aka WalletConnect).

## What is Reown?
Reown (aka WalletConnect) is an open protocol for connecting desktop DApps to mobile wallets using end-to-end encryption by scanning a QR code. It allows users to interact with any DApp without compromising their private keys. For more details, visit the [Reown documentation](https://reown.com/).
