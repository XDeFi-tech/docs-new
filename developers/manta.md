# Manta (ETH)

Manta is a zero-knowledge (zk) Layer 2 network built to scale Ethereum with enhanced privacy and performance. Powered by zk-rollup technology and EVM compatibility, Manta allows developers to deploy existing Ethereum smart contracts while benefiting from faster transactions and lower fees.

Manta is designed to support privacy-preserving decentralized applications (dApps), especially in areas like DeFi, identity, and Web3 credentials. With support for zk-enabled features out of the box, Manta offers a next-generation platform for building secure, scalable, and private blockchain solutions.

This documentation is based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the Ethereum network.
