# Linea (ETH)

Linea is a zkEVM-based Layer 2 network developed by ConsenSys, designed to scale Ethereum while preserving full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. It leverages zero-knowledge rollups (zk-rollups) to offer fast, low-cost transactions with strong security guarantees inherited from Ethereum.

Linea enables developers to deploy existing Ethereum smart contracts without modification, making it easy to build scalable dApps for DeFi, NFTs, and beyond. With native support from MetaMask and other ConsenSys tools, Linea offers a seamless development and user experience.

This documentation is based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the Ethereum network.
