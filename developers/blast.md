# Blast (ETH)

Blast is an Ethereum Layer 2 network designed to offer native yield for both ETH and stablecoins. Built by the team behind Blur, Blast provides a unique approach by integrating yield-generating mechanisms directly into the Layer 2 infrastructure. It is fully EVM-compatible, allowing developers to deploy Ethereum smart contracts seamlessly.

Blast not only inherits Ethereumâ€™s security but also offers a built-in incentive model, making it attractive for both users and developers who seek high-performance and capital-efficient applications in DeFi, NFTs, and beyond.
