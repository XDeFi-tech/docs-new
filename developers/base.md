# Base (ETH)

Base is a Layer 2 scaling solution built on Ethereum, developed by Coinbase using Optimismâ€™s OP Stack. It aims to provide a secure, low-cost, and developer-friendly platform for building decentralized applications (dApps). Fully EVM-compatible, Base allows developers to deploy Ethereum smart contracts with minimal or no changes to existing code.

Base is designed to help connect and scale the Ethereum ecosystem by offering a seamless environment that bridges Web3 infrastructure and Web2 products.

This documentation is based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the Ethereum network.
