# Arbitrum (AETH)

Arbitrum is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It is a sidechain that uses a technology called rollups to process transactions off-chain and then batch them into a single transaction that is submitted to the Ethereum mainnet. This allows for faster and cheaper transactions.

This document based on the EVMs (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and the Ethereum network.
