# Optimism (ETH)

Optimism is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, which is designed to enable fast, secure, and low-cost transactions. It is built on the Optimistic Ethereum (OÎž) protocol, which is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible layer 2 scaling solution. Optimism is designed to be a general-purpose scaling solution, which means that it can be used to scale any Ethereum application, including DeFi, NFTs, and more.

This document is based on the EVMs (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and the Ethereum network.
