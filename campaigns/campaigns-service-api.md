# Campaigns Service API

Welcome to the XDEFI Campaigns Service API documentation. This API allows third-party websites to connect a list of addresses from an external source to the XDEFI Wallet's internal list of opted-in ad

### Base URL

The base URL for all API endpoints is: https://campaign-ts.xdefi.services/api

### Workflow

The high-level workflow for the XDEFI Campaigns Service API is as follows:

1. A third-party website sends a list of addresses from any XDEFI-supported chain to the Campaigns Service API. These addresses fulfill certain criteria determined by the third-party website.
2. XDEFI maintains an internal list of user addresses that have opted into the Campaigns feature in XDEFI Wallet.
3. The Campaigns Service API cross-references the third-party list of addresses with the internal list of opted-in addresses.
4. If there is a match between a third-party address and an opted-in address, the corresponding EVM address is identified.
5. A request is made to the Campaigns Service API from a website like Galxe, using an endpoint such as `https://campaign-ts.xdefi.services/api/campaigns/{campaign_name}/address/{evm_address}/`.
6. The request includes a user's EVM address.
7. If the user's EVM address meets both criteria:
   - The EVM address is in the XDEFI list of opted-in addresses (indicating participation in the campaign).
   - The corresponding SOL address is in the third-party list of addresses (indicating completion of the task).
8. If the criteria are met, the API returns TRUE to Galxe.

Note: The requested address will always be in the EVM format, but the corresponding address could be on any XDEFI-supported chain.
