## Installation

To use Chainslib in your TypeScript project, you can install it via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @xdefi-tech/chains
# or
yarn add @xdefi-tech/chains
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use this library in your TypeScript application:

### 1. Import Required Modules

```typescript
import { BitcoinProvider } from "./chain.provider";
import LedgerSigner from "./ledger.signer";
import { MsgBody, Msg } from "../msg";
```

### 2. Initialize Bitcoin Provider

Initialize the Bitcoin provider with the necessary configurations:

```typescript
const provider = new BitcoinProvider(new IndexerDataSource(BITCOIN_MANIFEST));
```

### 3. Create Transaction Input

Define the transaction input data, including the sender (from), recipient (to), and the amount to send.

```typescript
const txInput: MsgBody = {
  from: "FROM ADDRESS",
  to: "TO ADDRESS",
  amount: 0.000001,
};
```

### 4. Create a Transaction Message

Create a transaction message using the provider:

```typescript
const message: Msg = provider.createMsg(txInput);
```

### 5. Sign the Transaction with Ledger

Use the LedgerSigner to sign the transaction. Provide the message and the derivation path:

```typescript
const transport = await Transport.create();
const signer = new LedgerSigner(transport);
const derivationPath = "m/84'/0'/0'/0/0";

await signer.sign(message, derivationPath);
// finally close
transport.close();
```

### 6. Broadcast the Transaction

Now that the transaction is signed, you can broadcast it to the Bitcoin network using the BitcoinProvider. This step assumes that the transaction is already signed within the `message`.

```typescript
await provider.broadcast([message]);
```

## Retrieving a Transaction

### 1. Get Transaction Hash

If you have a transaction hash, you can retrieve the transaction details. Use the `getTransaction` method of the BitcoinProvider:

```typescript
const txHash = "TX HAS";
const txData = await provider.getTransaction(txHash);
```

The `txData` object will contain transaction details, including the transaction hash.
