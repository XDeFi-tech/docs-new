# Audits

Security is the first and most important manner for Wallets provider.

At XDEFI Technologies, we want our users using Ctrl Wallet to interact safely on our large list of [supported blockchains](./supported-blockchains) and also feel secure

_Note that we will always recommend you for more security to use one of our [supported Hardware wallets](./supported-hardware-wallets)._

We continuously try to improve our security by having audits from different providers. The list below retrieve all the previous audits made:

- I don't remind - 2020
- Kudelski Security audit - 2021
- New one - 2024

As of 2024, we are open sourcing part of our repositories. We encourage users, developers and security researchers to help us maintaining the best level of security, and report us any finding using our [bug bounty program](./bug-bounty-program)
