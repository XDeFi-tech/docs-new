## Does XDEFI have control of my coins?

XDEFI Wallet is a non-custodial wallet.

Assets and NFT's are store on the different blockchains you are using and not in the wallet like the fiat money you can handle in a portfolio. Your wallet act as a signer and only allows you to view and manage them by interacting with the blockchains used.

XDEFI Wallet **doesn't** have access to your secret phrase, password or recovery code.

You are in **complete control of your information and your wallet**, so please keep your secret phrase safe and store it offline!

## How do I connect to a dApp if I don't see the XDEFI Wallet logo?

XDEFI Wallet can connect to all dApps on all [supported blockchains](./supported-blockchains.md).

In many cases you will see the XDEFI Wallet logo when you go to `connect wallet`.  
If you do not see it, you can still connect to the dapp by clicking on the first wallet in the list, usually MetaMask, Keplr or Phantom.
Please make sure you have **prioritize XDEFI** feature turned on in your XDEFI Wallet settings.

## Can I migrate my MetaMask or Keplr wallet to XDEFI Wallet?

**Yes**, you can migrate any wallet to XDEFI Wallet using your wallet's seed phrase. This process only takes a few seconds, and all of your assets and NFTs will immediately appear in XDEFI Wallet.

## What is a non-custodial wallet?

Unlike centralized exchanges, **non-custodial wallets** offer you **full control** over your seed phrase, private keys and assets (including NFTs). Forgetting or losing your seed phrase and private keys means losing access to your deposit addresses and the funds you hold on them, so make sure to back them up.
We recommend **offline storage on at least two devices**, one of which has FLASH memory. Encrypting the digital device holding this information is a good practice as long as you remember your decryption password.
