# Supported Blockchains

XDEFI Wallet make it possible for users to access, interact and build with more ecosystems and blockchains than any other in the market. There is two different way for blockchains to be supported:

- **Native integration**

Maintained and indexed by XDEFI team, native integration include more visiblity in the wallet (eg. historical details), more privacy (eg. proxies on multiple RPC by default) and dedicated feature of the chain (eg. staking in wallet).

- **Custom integration**

Not maintained and indexed by XDEFI team, custom integration are supported by using public repositories and public nodes. There is no historical details included and no dedicated feature from the blockchain on them.

The list below retrieve all the natives integrations supported by XDEFI Wallet.
