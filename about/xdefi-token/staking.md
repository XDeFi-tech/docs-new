# Stake $XDEFI token

[[toc]]

$XDEFI tokens can be staked into $vXDEFI tokens that allow stakers earning part of XDEFI Technologies products revenues.

To view the current APY, key staking metrics or stake your $XDEFI tokens, you can visit our [Web App interface](https://app.xdefi.io/stake).

_Staked $XDEFI tokens auto-compound and can be withdrawn at any time._

## What is $vXDEFI?

When you stake $XDEFI tokens, you receive $vXDEFI.

$vXDEFI represents your claim on the pool of staked $XDEFI and $XDEFI rewards.
You can convert between $XDEFI and $vXDEFI at any time. There is no fee involved other than standard Ethereum network fees.  
75% of all swap and bridge fees from all XDEFI Technologies products are paid to the $vXDEFI pool and distributed to stakers.

::: info
In the near-term, $XDEFI staking rewards will continue to be supplemented with funds from the [XDEFI Treasury](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x6ebC49c6bda9BAF75E631e83eF8A91Fa256F7a51).

## Why is there an exchange rate between $XDEFI and vXDEFI?

When you stake $XDEFI you are swapping it for a claim on the overall staking pool.
As more people enter the staking pool, and as more $XDEFI rewards are added to the pool, the relative value of each claim changes.

The amount of $XDEFI tokens you can withdraw will always be greater than or equal to the amount you deposited.
You will not lose any $XDEFI tokens by staking them.
The USD value of $XDEFI will change over time, so the overall USD value of your tokens might be more or less compared to when you staked.

::: info

- Withdrawal of staked $XDEFI tokens will always be available (plus any rewards already earned), at any time.
- $vXDEFI holders will always be able to withdraw at least the same number of $XDEFI tokens as staked.
- The USD value of staked $XDEFI will always vary and fluctuate according to market conditions.
- Gas fees in $ETH will need to paid on Ethereum for any actions (stake, unstake and withdraw - for both the old and new staking contracts).
