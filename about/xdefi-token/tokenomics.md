## Token Distribution

GRAPH TO BE ADDED

::: info
These percentages are approximate and subject to change depending on the size and growth of the team and its advisors as well as the requirements of the Ecosystem Fund.
:::

### 46% to the Ecosystem Fund

The Ecosystem Fund is controlled by **$XDEFI** token governance and the team.

These tokens can be used to supplement **$XDEFI** staking rewards, provide grants to developers and partners, fund certain programs such as Play to (L)earn and other programs that are designed to grow the Ecosystem.

### 28% to Early Investors

XDEFI’s early investors who funded the initial development of Ctrl Wallet. The investments took place over two private funding rounds in 2021 and 2022.
::: info
These tokens are subject to a 3-year schedule.
:::

### 15% to the Ctrl (fka XDEFI) team

Current and future team members allocation.
::: info
These tokens are subject to a 4-year vesting schedule for each team member.
:::

### 9% to the Public Sale

Investors in the XDEFI public sale which took place on 15 November 2021.
::: info
These tokens were immediately available to Public Sale investors following the Dutch Auction.
:::

### 2% to Advisors

Individuals that provided critical advice and support early in XDEFI’s development.
::: info
These tokens are subject to a 3-year vesting schedule beginning in April 2022.
:::

::: info
Initially we allocated 16% of **$XDEFI** tokens to a Play to (L)earn initiative that would incentivise users to learn how to use Ctrl Wallet and how to explore DeFi safely.

We still intend to pursue this initiative, but we plan to do so at a smaller scale than initially envisioned.

Therefore the 16% of tokens reserved for the Play to (L)earn initiative have now been reclassified as part of the Ecosystem Fund.
