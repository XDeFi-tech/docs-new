## Trading Activity

**XDEFI** generates revenue from swaps and bridge (applications/platforms using it are listed [here](../xdefi-technologies/routing-api#current-platforms-using-the-routing-api)).

-> 75% of the net revenue generated from all swaps, bridging and staking are used to buy **$XDEFI** on the open market.

These purchased tokens are rewarded to token holders who stake **$XDEFI**.

::: info

- XDEFI swap fees are 0.30%.
- Swaps fees via THORChain DEX aggregator provider are 0.15%.
- Swap fees are more than 50% less expensive than the 0.85% charged at MetaMask and Phantom as of 15 May 2023.
  :::

This model creates a virtuous cycle for the **$XDEFI** token holders:

- More XDEFI Wallet and Web App users means
- Larger swap & bridge volume (and more fees earned), which means
- Larger $XDEFI buybacks and greater rewards for $XDEFI stakers

::: info
In the near-term, **$XDEFI** staking rewards will continue to be supplemented with funds from the [XDEFI Treasury](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x6ebC49c6bda9BAF75E631e83eF8A91Fa256F7a51).

## Staking Activity

XDEFI Technologies will implement staking within wallet throught partners during 2024.

Here is our current list of partner:

- [Meria](https://www.meria.com)
- [StakeLab](https://www.stakelab.zone)

While users will have the option to stake with the validator of their choice in the interface, the default validator will be a partner with whom commissions fees will be splitted, thus improving XDEFI revenue.

## Liquidity Provision

XDEFI Wallet has partnered with Portals.fi to implement single-sided liquidity provision directly from within its products.

The swap fee are 0.25%, [as voted on May 3, 2023](https://snapshot.org/#/xdefigovernance.eth/proposal/0x03d8b40bf909dab396b6a13c4368240c226f0943ccbe6ab9c638f0cbd28ffac8).

-> 75% of the net revenue will be used to buyback $XDEFI on the open market and the $XDEFI will be rewarded to stakers.

## Gas Abstraction

XDEFI Wallet is introducing an innovative new feature that allows users to lock up stable coins to pay for transaction fees in a "gas tank."

This reserve will enable quick and easy payment of transaction fees without the need for multiple transactions or disruptions in the flow of activity.

A fee will be charged when funds are deposited in stables into the gas tank (TBD).
