# Utility

$XDEFI has four main utilities:

1. [Staking](utility#staking)
2. [Governance](utility#governance-rights)
3. [Gas abstraction](utility#gas-abstraction)
4. [Premium features.](utility#premium-features)

## Staking

The follows a **veModel**, which is a design originally pioneered by Curve. It allows token holders to stake and earn a share of XDEFI swap and bridge fees.

XDEFI generates revenue from swaps (both in-wallet and [platforms integrating the Routing API](../xdefi-technologies/routing-api#current-platforms-using-the-routing-api)), as well as single-sided staking (Zaps), which is a feature of our Web App.

75% of the net revenue generated from all swaps, bridging and staking are used to buy **$XDEFI** on the open market. These purchased tokens are rewarded to token holders who stake them.

:::tip NOTE
In the near-term, $XDEFI staking rewards will continue to be supplemented with funds from the [XDEFI Treasury](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x6ebC49c6bda9BAF75E631e83eF8A91Fa256F7a51).

## Gas abstraction

est. Q1 2024

This feature will permit $XDEFI tokens to be locked up in a gas tank to cover gas costs for transaction signing within the wallet and when interacting with external dApps. This is done to provide a seamless and simplified user experience, without having to worry about storing gas tokens on each address.

## Premium Features

est. 2024

In the future, further utility for **$XDEFI** token holders will be launched including for example wallet skins & preferential access to certain XDEFI Campaigns.
