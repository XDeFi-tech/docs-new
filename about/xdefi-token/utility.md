## Staking

**XDEFI Technologies** created a staking contract that follows a **veModel**, which is a design originally pioneered by Curve. It allows token holders to stake and earn a share of XDEFI Technologies products revenues.

**XDEFI** generates revenue from swaps (both in-wallet and [platforms integrating the Routing API](../xdefi-technologies/routing-api#current-platforms-using-the-routing-api)), as well as single-sided staking (Zaps), which is a feature of our Web App.

75% of the net revenue generated from all swaps, bridging and staking are used to buy **$XDEFI** on the open market.

These purchased tokens are rewarded to token holders who stake them.

::: info
In the near-term, **$XDEFI** staking rewards will continue to be supplemented with funds from the [XDEFI Treasury](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x6ebC49c6bda9BAF75E631e83eF8A91Fa256F7a51).

## Governance rights

Today, **$XDEFI** token holders and stakers can vote on community proposals such as native chain integrations, new product features, and fee distribution.

This gives holders a say in the development of the platform.

You can vote, view historical governance proposals and results on [Snapshot website](https://snapshot.org/#/xdefigovernance.eth).

## Gas abstraction

_est. Q1 2024_

This feature will permit **$XDEFI** tokens to be locked up in a gas tank to cover gas costs for transaction signing within the wallet and when interacting with external dApps.

This is done to provide a seamless and simplified user experience, without having to worry about storing gas tokens on each address.

## Premium Features

_est. 2024_

In the future, further utility for **$XDEFI** token holders will be launched including for example wallet skins & preferential access to certain XDEFI Campaigns.
