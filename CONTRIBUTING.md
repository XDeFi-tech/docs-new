# Contributing to XDEFI Documentation
## Introduction

This document is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project. These are guidelines, not rules. This guide is meant to make it easy for you to get involved.

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project. It's people like you that make this documentation better for everyone.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open-source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

XDEFI Technologies is a community-driven project, and we welcome contributions from the community. Whether you're fixing a typo, adding a new feature, or changing the documentation, we'd love to have your contributions.

Please, don't use the issue tracker for personal support requests. Instead, use the [XDEFI Discord](https://discord.gg/xdefi) for support.

## Ground Rules

Responsibilities

- Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian, Ubuntu Linux.
- Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- Don't add any classes to the CSS that you're not using.
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.
- Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

## Contribution workflow

1. Search for an existing issue or create a new one to start a discussion around your idea or bug. Make sure no one else is already working on it, and assign yourself to the issue if you plan to work on it. If you don't have permissions to assign yourself, leave a comment asking for it.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Create and checkout a new branch for your work, naming it relevantly. We recommend naming your branch with the issue number and a short description of the issue (e.g., `issue-123-fix-typo`), which is a reminder to fix only one issue in a PR.
4. Open the project in your favorite editor and start making your changes.
5. Commit your changes, briefly describing what you did in the commit message. Push your changes to your branch.
6. On this repository, navigate to the "Pull Requests" tab and click on "New Pull Request". Describe your changes in detail, including the issue number you're addressing. If you're not ready for a review yet, you can open a draft pull request.
7. Specific reviewers will be assigned to your pull request. If you don't get a response within a week, feel free to ask for a review in the Discord channel.
8. Make changes to your pull request if the reviewer asks for them. Once the reviewer approves your changes, the pull request will be merged.

## Code review process

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in a weekly triage meeting that we hold in Discord. The meeting is used to discuss Pull Requests and Issues. The meeting is open to the public, and you are welcome to join.

After feedback has been given, the Pull Request author should respond within a week. After a week with no response, the Pull Request may be closed.

## How to report a bug

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email [info@xdefi.io](mailto:info@xdefi.io) instead.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of the documentation are you using?
2. What did you do?
3. What did you expect to see?
4. What did you see instead?
5. What operating system are you using?

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in the documentation, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that exist in the documentation started as a pull request from a single contributor.

When suggesting a feature, please provide as much detail as possible. Explain what the feature would do and how it would be useful to other users.

## Community

Discussions about the documentation take place on the [XDEFI Discord](https://discord.gg/xdefi).

We also available on [X](https://twitter.com/xdefi_wallet) and [Telegram](https://t.me/xdefi_announcements).
